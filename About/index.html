    <h3 style="color: white; padding-bottom:20px; padding-top:10px;">My name is Christine Nakano, and I am currently a senior at James Campbell High School. I was born and raised in Honolulu, Hawaii and I am an only child. I am half-Japanese and half-Korean. I was raised in a Christian family and have been attending my current church for more than 10 years.<br> In my free time I enjoy sleeping, going on my computer, and listening to music. On my breaks or vacation, I enjoy travelling; many of it being part of mission trips. So far (including in the United States), I have been to Los Angeles, Texas, Seattle, Mexico, Indonesia, Nepal, Korea, Netherlands, Greece, Rome, and Israel twice. From those trips, I have many stories to tell which you can see in my travel gallery.<br>For my future career, I want to do something on the lines of Biomedical Engineering or Molecular Biosciences and Biotechnology. I have always been interested in the medical field because my dad is a paramedic. I am also into the engineering field because I am interested in working with computers, coding, and building things.</h3>
